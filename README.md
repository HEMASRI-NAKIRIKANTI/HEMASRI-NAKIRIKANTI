# 👋 Hi, I'm Hema Sri Nakirikanti

### 🚀 Generative AI Engineer | LLM Platforms | Agentic RAG Systems

I design and deploy **production-grade Generative AI and Machine Learning systems** that are **secure, scalable, observable, and reliable at enterprise scale**.  
My work focuses on **LLM platforms, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic workflows, and evaluation-driven AI reliability**.

## 🔥 What I Specialize In

### 🤖 Generative AI & LLM Platforms
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Agentic AI (tool-calling, routing, multi-step reasoning)
- Prompt engineering, optimization, and guardrails
- Hallucination detection, grounding, and evaluation

### 🧠 Applied Machine Learning
- NLP systems (classification, NER, sentiment analysis)
- Document intelligence & knowledge extraction
- Computer vision pipelines (object detection, image classification)

### 🏗 ML Platform & MLOps Engineering
- End-to-end ML lifecycle (train → deploy → monitor → retrain)
- CI/CD for models and data pipelines
- Monitoring, rollback, and model governance

- Model versioning, lineage, and audit trails
- Secrets management and environment isolation

---

## 📈 Engineering Principles

- Treat ML models as **production software**
- Design for **observability before optimization**
- Evaluation is **non-negotiable**
- Balance **latency, cost, and accuracy**
- Build guardrails **before** scaling usage
- Prefer simple, debuggable systems

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

**ML:** Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  
**GenAI:** Faithfulness, Groundedness, BLEU, ROUGE, Retrieval Relevance
